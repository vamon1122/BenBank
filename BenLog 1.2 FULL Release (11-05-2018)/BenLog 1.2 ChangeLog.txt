1.3 Ideas
  - Add line concatinator

1.2
 - Added 'Debug mode'. If debug mode is off, debug messages will not be written to the log.
 - Added LogItem class
 - Added LogReader class. Reads log and converts records into into LogItem objects.
 - Implemented 'DeleteLog' method
 - Removed ShowVers as it was causing crashes (I think a stack overflow but no sure)
 - Added LogFileDir & LogFileName properties.
